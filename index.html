    <div class="intro">
        <p>The Messerschmitt Bf 109 is a German World War II fighter aircraft that was, along with the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, the backbone of the Luftwaffe's fighter force. <br> The Bf 109 first saw operational service in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War and
            was still in service at the end of World War II in 1945. <br> It was one of the most advanced fighters when it first appeared, with an all-metal monocoque construction, a closed canopy, and retractable landing gear. <br> It was powered by
            a liquid-cooled, inverted-V12 aero engine. <br> It was called the Me 109 by Allied aircrew and some German aces, even though this was not the official German designation.

                <div class="caption">The Bf 109A was the first version of the Bf 109. Armament was initially planned to be just two cowl-mounted 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns. However, possibly due to the introduction of the Hurricane and Spitfire, each with eight
                    7.7 mm (.303 in) machine guns, experiments were carried out with a third machine gun firing through the propeller shaft. V4 and some A-0 were powered by a 640 PS (631 hp, 471 kW) Junkers Jumo 210B engine driving a two-blade fixed-pitch
                    propeller, but production was changed to the 670 PS (661 hp, 493 kW) Jumo 210D as soon as it became available.</div>

                <div class="caption">The first Bf 109 in serial production, the Bf 109 B-1, was fitted with the 670 PS (661 hp, 493 kW) Jumo 210D engine driving a two-bladed fixed-pitch propeller. During the production run a variable-pitch propeller was introduced and often
                    retrofitted to older aircraft; these were then unofficially known as B-2s. The Bf 109B saw combat with the Legion Condor during the Spanish Civil War, although it was apparent that the armament was still inadequate. A total of 341
                    Bf 109 B-1s were built by Messerschmitt, Fieseler, and the Erla Maschinenwerke.</div>

                <div class="caption">Production of the short-lived Bf 109C began in the spring of 1938. The 109C was powered by a 700 PS (690 hp, 515 kW) Jumo 210G engine with direct fuel injection. Another important change was a strengthened wing, now carrying two more machine
                    guns, giving four 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17s in total. The C-0s were pre-production aircraft, the C-1 was the production version, and the C-2 was an experimental version with an engine-mounted machine gun. The C-3 was planned with 20
                    mm MG FF cannons replacing the two MG 17s in the wings, but it is not known how many C-3s (if any) were built or converted. The C-4 was planned to have an engine-mounted Motorkanone MG FF, but this variant was not produced. A total
                    of 58 Bf 109Cs of all versions were built by Messerschmitt.</div>

                <div class="caption">Variants included the D-0 and D-1 models, both having a Junkers Jumo 210D engine and armed with two wing-mounted and two nose-mounted 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17s. The D-2 was an experimental version with an engine-mounted machine gun, but
                    as previously tried, this installation failed. The D-3 was similar to the C-3 but with two 20 mm MG FFs in the wings. A total of 647 Bf 109Ds of all versions were built by Focke-Wulf, Erla, Fieseler, Arado and AGO. Messerschmitt is
                    listed as having produced only four Bf 109Ds, probably the D-0 preproduction series with the serial production transferred to the licensed manufacturers. Several Bf 109Ds were sold to Hungary. Switzerland bought 10 109D-1s (Serial
                    Numbers from 2301 until 2310) which had been built by the Arado-Flugzeugwerke GmbH factory located in Warnem√ºnde.</div>
